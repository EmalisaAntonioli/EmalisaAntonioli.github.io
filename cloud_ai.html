                    <p class="lead mb-5 text-start">
                        In this project, we set out to develop a deep learning pipeline to identify diseases in crop images. 
                        The overarching goal was to create a robust classification model capable of distinguishing between healthy and diseased plant leaves based on visual features. 
                        The workflow included exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing and augmentation, model selection, training, and performance evaluation. 
                        The project culminated in comparing several CNN architectures to determine which performed best under our constraints and dataset.

                    <p class="lead mb-5 text-start">
                        Our work began with a detailed exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset’s structure and identify any potential quality issues. 
                        We observed noticeable class imbalance, which risked skewing model performance. To address this, we implemented targeted data augmentation techniques to enrich underrepresented classes and improve generalization. 
                        We experimented with several machine learning architectures, including MobileNet, EfficientNet, and ResNe, evaluating each on accuracy, training time, and inference efficiency. 
                        Hyperparameter tuning and fine-tuning of pre-trained networks were done to boost performance without overfitting. 
                        The final comparison showed that EfficientNetB0 provided the best trade-off between accuracy and speed, especially on low-resource systems.

                    <h3 class="text-secondary mb-0">My Contribution</h3>
                    <p class="lead mb-5 text-start">
                        This project was a collaboration with three other students (Jeffrey Stynen, Hannah Cimene, and Liesa Moors), but we each developed our own model, which we then compared at the end. 
                        In this part of the work, I focused on building an end-to-end model development pipeline using PyCaret. 
                        This allowed for rapid prototyping and benchmarking of multiple classification algorithms on the preprocessed crop disease dataset. 
                        I experimented with various models, including decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting, leveraging PyCaret’s built-in tools for model comparison, cross-validation, and performance visualization. 
                        After narrowing down the top-performing models, I refined the training pipeline with feature normalization, data balancing techniques, and interpretability tools like confusion matrices and feature importance charts. 
                        This process gave me hands-on experience with model selection, tuning, and evaluation in a low-code environment, and helped me understand how to balance automation with manual control in a data science workflow. 
                        Ultimately, it deepened my appreciation for tools that accelerate experimentation while still allowing meaningful insight into model behavior.
