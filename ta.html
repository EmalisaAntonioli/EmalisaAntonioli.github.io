                    <p class="lead mb-5 text-start">
                        My love for computer science started when following programming courses during my time studying chemistry at university, so I decided to become a teaching assistant at the <a href="https://www.proglab.nl/programs/minprog/">programming group</a> at the University of Amsterdam. During this time I assisted the lecturers in providing their courses, mainly by helping students with their individual problems. The courses with which I helped included introduction in C, introduction in Python, webdesign with Django and Flask, as well as data science basics with SQL and pandas.

                    <h3 class="text-secondary mb-0">My Experience</h3>
                    <p class="lead mb-5 text-start">
                        I am very grateful for this experience. At the beginning of the semester I started as a mentor for a group of about fifteen students in the minor programme. My role included being a point of contact for these students and hosting weekly checkups to make sure everyone remained on track, as well as aiding all students in the programme with their programming assignments. This included not just mastering the course content and being able to communicate with the students, but also communicating with my fellow ta's and the professors. Later in the semester my role was broadened to also running a weekly, day-long programming workshop for the students from the AI bachelor that failed their first programming course, trying to prevent them from falling behind. This involved a lot of patience and constant reinventing ways of explaining the same material, to try to reach every student. This experience did not just teach me important professional soft skills, such as teaching, tutoring, planning, I also improved my fundamental programming skills.
