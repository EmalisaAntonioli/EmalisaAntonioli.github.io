                    <p class="lead mb-5 text-start">
                        This project was part of a deep learning course from the third and final year of the bachelor. We were tasked with creating a deep learning model to autonomously drive a car in Forza Horizon 4. 
                        The project went from collecting image and controller data, through training a model, to controlling the car in real time. 
                        We also developed an object detection module using YOLO to recognize in-game obstacles like other cars and buses.

                    <h3 class="text-secondary mb-0">Project Realization</h3>
                    <p class="lead mb-5 text-start">
                        We started by designing a custom data collection system that captured screenshots and logged controller inputs every 0.5 seconds, embedding the values into the filenames to simplify labeling. 
                        After applying data augmentations, we noticed an imbalance in steering angle distribution. This made it difficult for the model to take turns. 
                        We visualized this imbalance, which helped identify that turns weren’t well represented. We resolved this by duplicating images with high steering angles to improve model generalization.

                        The model training began with a classification approach but later transitioned to a regression model based on ResNet50, better suited for predicting continuous joystick values. 
                        The trained model was integrated into a virtual controller setup that allowed real-time control in the game. As an extra, we built a YOLOv11 object detection model, although this wasn’t integrated into live driving due to hardware limits.
                        Below you can find a video, where the model autonomously plays the game for 30 seconds.

                    <h3 class="text-secondary mb-0">My Contribution</h3>
                    <p class="lead mb-3 text-start">
                        This was a group project with two other students. I was primarily responsible for writing the data collection code, which automatically gathered game screenshots and controller inputs, and embedding them into structured filenames for easy access during training. 
                        I also contributed to developing the data augmentation strategy and actively participated in the training process. 
                        A key moment for me was when I visualized the steering angle distribution and uncovered a critical dataset imbalance, which directly influenced our approach to data augmentation and improved the model’s ability to handle turns. 
                        Through this, I gained valuable experience in building practical data pipelines, managing datasets for computer vision, and understanding how thoughtful data preparation and balancing can have a bigger impact on a model’s performance than tweaking the network itself.
